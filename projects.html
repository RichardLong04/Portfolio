        <p class="paragraph">Here are a few projects that I’ve accomplished so far. They are either from school or on my own for practice. I've also inculded my first freelance site. My favorite part of each project was challenging myself to learn something new and/or learning from the mistakes that were made along the way. In the near future, I will be adding new sites that will show improved growth and new skills that I am developing.

          <h3>MONKAA</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">Monkaa, was one of my first project at Seattle University. The objective was to embed media into a website using HTML and CSS. I was provided all of the media assets and images. I decided to make everything nice and centered, so it would be easier to see quickly. I made the site responsive, even though it wasn’t required. I wanted to challenge myself and learn more. </p>

          <h3>API SUPERSTORE</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">API Superstore, was a project at Seattle University. This was our second project using Boot Strap 3. There were guidelines and specific assets that we were required to use, so everyone did an API Superstore site. IF I remember correctly, it was supposed to be one page that navigated to different sections of the page. This was also an exercise in creating mobile first. I’m not sure why I used such a bold color pallet, but it was well received by my cohorts, or maybe they were just being polite. This was also the first time I used git hub and git</p>

          <p class="paragraph">About Me, was my final project at Illinois Institute of Technology. We were supposed to be creating a site using HTML5, CSS3, and basic JavaScript. GitHub was also required to be used my code was checked and the amount of commits I made were also graded. I really didn’t spend any time thinking about content everything is basically a place holder to be altered later. I received an A on the project, but I don’t like it and second guess some of the choices I made. I hope to go back and clean it up and add legitimate content someday.

          <p class="paragraph">ISUD, this was my final project for Spring term. This by far was one of the most challenging learning experiences to date for me. The objective was to redesign/improve a poorly designed existing website, as a team working remotely utilizing a GitHub group repository. We would meet every few days on meetup to discuss the project and see what each team member was working on. My biggest take away from this project was learning that having clear, concise goals and communication will be key to success with any future projects. </p>

I used Bootstrap 3 and used the layout of the old site as my reference for the new site. Also, the old site wasn’t responsive and that was something the client wanted too. I used images from the old site and cleaned them up in photoshop, and I had all of their company’s clients send me current .png files of their new logos to work into a logo parade for the home page. In the end the customer was happy and I got paid. </p>
